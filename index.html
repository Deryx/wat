			<p>Muay Thai is the national sport of Thailand known in English as Thai Boxing. It originated over 1,000 years ago, and has evolved from military origins into the vastly popular international sport that it is today. Professional bouts are 5-three minute rounds, and take place in a standard boxing ring, with one competitor fighting from the red corner, and one from the blue. Thai boxers fight bare foot and without headgear &mdash; boxing gloves are the only padding worn. Bouts can be won by knock out, technical knock out, or by points. The rules allow the use of boxing, kicking, elbowing and kneeing to all parts of the body. This makes Thai Boxing incrediby effective and practical as a self-defense art.</p>
